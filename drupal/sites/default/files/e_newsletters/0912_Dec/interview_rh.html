				  		AN INTERVIEW WITH RICK HOLMES<br>

						<strong>Q: In Southern Nevada, what major impacts is climate change having on water resources and what do you expect 
						looking ahead?<br>
						A:</strong> Ninety percent of our water comes from the Colorado River. Climate change has created a huge expansion of 
						uncertainty about future conditions in the Colorado Basin, and that system was already highly variable. Climate change 
						compounds the existing variability. Current estimates tell us that we should expect 5-20% reduction in flows by 2050. 
						Meanwhile, it is our responsibility to provide a safe and reliable water supply to two million residents, and we are 
						expecting more. We need to be prepared for a warmer and dryer Colorado River Basin and more frequent and more severe 
						water shortages due to climate change. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: What made you realize that this situation was new and that existing water management practices and 
						policies were not going to be adequate to meet it?<br>
						A:</strong> The drought conditions that started in 1999 were a wake up call for all water managers in the Colorado 
						River Basin. In the years 2000-2004 we had the lowest five-year runoff in recorded history, and those measurements 
						had been going on since early 1900s. Inflows to Lake Powell averaged 50% of normal.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						Faced with rapidly declining inflow and storage in Lake Powell and Lake Mead, the Secretary of the Interior called 
						together water managers in the seven Basin states to examine how reservoirs were managed and operated in this 
						record-breaking drought period. By 2007, a number of new agreements were finalized for river operations, interstate 
						water banking, apportionment of lower basin shortages, and conservation and other forms of intentionally created 
						surplus (the Colorado River Accord of 2007). 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						That drought is continuing, and we are still seeing declines in Lake Mead. We're looking at a variety of new options 
						and agreements. When and if the lake goes twenty feet below where it is now, we will hit a trigger point set by the 
						Accord, that sets various measures in motion. If we drop to the third trigger point, we basically need to get back 
						together and meet again.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						We're spending hundreds of millions of dollars driven by climate change. We have an aggressive conservation program, 
						and we're constructing

						 facilities so we will still have the ability to deliver water at 
						lower lake levels. A third, lower intake is now being constructed. We're working to diversify water resources and 
						taking short-term measures such as water banking in Arizona. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>						
						<strong>Q: We're also talking this month to Steve Whitney, who looks as water issues from the perspective of the 
						Pacific Northwest.How would you compare your issues to those of that region?<br>
						A:</strong> When you compare us to the Pacific Northwest, on the surface, we have a different water resource picture. 
						We're dealing with water shortages,		they will be dealing with issues such as sea level rise, but there are more 
						similarities than differences. Most regions are very much concerned about the impacts of climate change. As members 
						of the Water Utility Climate Alliance, large utilities throughout the west are working to improve the science of 
						global climate modeling, accelerate climate-change research, and to develop climate-change adaptation strategies.  
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: The Southern Nevada Water Authority has participated actively in the Carpe Diem Project. What is the value 
						of Carpe Diem to the SNWA?<br>
						A:</strong> Our General Manager, Pat Mulroy, has been very outspoken about the need for collaboration in dealing with 
						water management issues. It's not new to us. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						It's safe to say that most of the reliable water supplies in the West are already allocated, and as we take a look 
						now, the issue is how scarcity is to be shared. The old model of competition will result in conflicts, competition, 
						stalemate. We have to highlight that the important goal is to increase cooperation and collaboration. Carpe Diem is an 
						opportunity to collaborate and address difficult climate change and water management issues in the West.
