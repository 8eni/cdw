						<strong>Q: In the Pacific Northwest, what major impacts is climate change having on water resources, and what do you 
						expect looking ahead?<br>
						A:</strong> First of all, the Pacific Northwest is a very diverse region, with areas lying east of the Cascade Range 
						affected somewhat differently than areas to the West.  In general though, climate change models suggest that the 
						region will likely see annual precipitation rates remain about the same, or perhaps increase a bit in coming decades. 
						That's the good news. The bad news is that this precipitation will arrive in the form of rain, not snow, and what snow 
						we do get will be subject to more frequent rain-on-snow events. Not only will this exacerbate the late winter and 
						spring flooding we've been seeing more regularly, it will lead to reduced summer flows in our rivers and streams. For 
						a region struggling with how to meet human water needs while saving our endangered salmon runs, that's a big problem.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: What made you realize that this situation was new and that existing water management practices and policies 
						were not going to be adequate to meet it?<br>
						A:</strong> Let's be honest, even with a stable climate, existing water management practices and policies would not be 
						adequate. Ten years ago, I served on the board of an organization that threatened to sue agricultural water users 
						under the Endangered Species Act for drying up salmon streams and leaving listed fish to die in isolated pools. The 
						photographic evidence was incontrovertible. As a result, the water users asked for a meeting, negotiations ensued, 
						and the threatened lawsuit was never filed. But the simple fact that our system of water management leads to dry 
						riverbeds every summer, all across the West, leads me to conclude something's not right. In light of climate change 
						impacts, ever-increasing population growth, heavy demands on water resources from energy production, and other 
						factors, I believe reform is inevitable.

						<strong>Q: We're also talking to Rick Holmes of the Southern Nevada Water Authority this month. How do you think 
						problems in that region differ from yours, and what similarities would you expect?<br>
						A:</strong> Assuming the climate models are accurate, the Southwest will need to deal with real reductions in annual 
						precipitation, while here in the Pacific Northwest we may primarily be grappling with

						changes in the form and timing of our
						precipitation. This distinction becomes less important during the summer months, when both regions will 
						struggle to meet human consumptive demands for water while also meeting societal demands to conserve healthy aquatic 
						ecosystems. I think we will find common cause as we recognize that the future availability of abundant and reliable 
						water resources will be dependent on our success in restoring and protecting the vitality and resiliency of our 
						watersheds &mdash; especially headwaters areas largely managed in the West by the US Forest Service. Mother Nature provides 
						a broad range of ecosystem services, none more important than water.

						<strong>Q: The Bullitt Foundation was the first financial investor in CDP two and half years ago and has continued to 
						fund the Project. Can you tell us what draws this continued support?<br>
						A:</strong> In 2006, staff from a couple of dozen private foundations met with leading water policy experts from 
						across the country to learn about water issues and the range of potential responses.  Among other things, we concluded 
						existing initiatives were insufficient, the water conversation lacked breadth, long-standing assumptions needed 
						re-examination, and a broader array of stakeholders deserved a seat at the table. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						The Carpe Diem Project directly responds to these observations with its impressive network of participants, its 
						ability to convene key players in a constructive and collaborative setting, its efforts to ensure that a broad range 
						of interests and perspectives are heard, and its insistence that the very best science inform the project. Investing 
						in the Carpe Diem process requires a leap of faith &mdash; by its very nature the project's outcomes cannot be predetermined. But if one is serious about wanting to invest in smart people working to find a sustainable path forward, it's a leap well worth taking.
