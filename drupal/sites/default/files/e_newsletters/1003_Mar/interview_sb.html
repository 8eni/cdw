						<strong>Q: In the Carpe Diem Project Headwaters policy brief that you wrote last summer you said we have a window of 
						opportunity now to make progress toward water and public land resource management policies that integrate the best 
						available science and acknowledge the new challenges posed by climate change and other pressures on public lands and 
						water resources. Do you still feel we have that opportunity?  
						<br><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" border="0"><br>
						SB:</strong> Absolutely. It's actually very timely. Here in the Rockies there is lots of public interest in the 
						changing forest conditions, especially related to pine beetles, drought, and fires.  Over half of our water comes from 
						national forest land, more in some areas.  Public awareness is key, and so is the present willingness of the Forest 
						Service to address climate change. It's important to remember that the Forest Service was originally founded to serve 
						two main purposes: one, to provide sustainable timber supplies, and two, to protect our nation's watershed. We're 
						really going back to first principles. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: Where do you see progress being made?
						<br><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" border="0"><br>
						SB:</strong> Public awareness at this point is about the change in the landscape &mdash; dying trees, especially. 
						More has to be done about making the connection to water supply and quality. More frequent and hotter fires will 
						affect how water is retained, with more erosion, silted streambeds, fewer fish. It's all piled on top of the effects 
						of climate change &mdash; changes in timing and type of precipitation &mdash; and it adds up in a bad way for our 
						streamflows and water quality. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						Even so, I'm encouraged by the broader public awareness of changes in the landscape, and by the statements and actions 
						of public officials. Both the Secretary of Agriculture and the Chief of the Forest Service have said that addressing 
						climate change impacts on national forests with respect to water is a priority issue.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						I'm also encouraged by some initiatives among downstream water users and communities. The City of Santa Fe is the 
						first to impose a user fee, an ecosystems services fee, on water customers to pay for restoration work in its 
						headwaters. This was facilitated by The Nature Conservancy. Water customers have long paid for the dams and pipelines 
						and other infrastructure, but not for the intact meadow that holds the water after snowmelt, or the intact forest that 
						holds the snow and anchors the soil. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						At the national level, there are proposals to set up pilot projects with Congressional funding for restoration projects. 
						The Wilderness Society has proposed a Healthy Headwaters Restoration Program, which would fund restoration projects aimed 
						at making ecosystems more resilient in the face of climate change. The connection has been made between climate change, 
						ecosystem health, and the water supply. Now we have to figure out the best way to incorporate these concerns into regular 
						management activities.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: What do you think it would take for planners at all levels to address water issues from source to final 
						use? How do you think the Carpe Diem Project is contributing or can contribute to this process?
						<br><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" border="0"><br>
						SB:</strong> We need to be more explicit about the fact that land management is water management. Especially in the 
						national forests we need to say we're managing for good quality water that's coming out of the high country in a 
						sustainable way. That mission needs to be refreshed, maybe through better incentives or other policy actions.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						One thing the Carpe Diem Project can do is facilitate dialogue among many people who are exploring these ideas. They 
						can say, "Let's look at Santa Fe. What is working here that can be applied elsewhere?" And from that we develop best 
						practices. Carpe Diem can conduct and encourage research into what needs to be changed in laws and policies to make it 
						possible to manage more effectively for water on the public lands.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						Carpe Diem also helps ideas that have grown in one place take root in another. I like that it's a place where folks 
						who might not know each other, or who might not even have heard about each other, get a chance to talk and share 
						ideas. Stories get told, lessons are highlighted, and we learn from each other.
