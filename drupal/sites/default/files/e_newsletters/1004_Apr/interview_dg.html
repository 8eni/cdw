						<strong>Q: At the Carpe Diem convening you noted the need for better integrated water and energy planning at the California PUC 
						and elsewhere. What would it take to get more focus on water at the CPUC?  
						<br><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" border="0"><br>
						DG:</strong> Several years ago the CPUC adopted for the first time a water action plan to guide its actions in the 
						water area. We are now in the process of updating the plan, and this is an area in particular where I think we can put 
						more emphasis on the linkage between water and energy issues, particularly leveraging our efforts for conservation. 
						We expect to have this revision complete in the summer of this year, and it will guide our actions in coming years. 
						In addition, in September 2008, the commission adopted the California Long-Term Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan, and 
						that plan noted that one limitation of planning was that it did not address the water-energy nexus. Part of the problem was 
						that there were other state agencies and groups heavily involved in these areas that we had not yet brought into our 
						process. I think that in our next update to the strategic plan we should put specific emphasis on the water-energy nexus. 
						Part of that will be obtaining better information than we now have about water usage in the state and about ways to save 
						energy by addressing water usage and conservation. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: Everyone at the convening was struck by the opportunities to enhance water efficiency in California using 
						the CPUC's home energy efficiency program. What would it take to better incorporate water into the program?
						<br><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" border="0"><br>
						DG:</strong> This spring we are launching the nation's largest home energy-efficiency retrofit program. Our goal is to 
						achieve on average at least 20% savings in residential energy usage. The program will include some water-efficiency 
						measures such as low-flow shower heads. In addition, some local governments are using federal stimulus money to add 
						enhanced features, particularly on water efficiency. One of the most exciting features is the increased use of 
						innovative financing for these programs. The San Francisco program, GreenInvestSF, for example, ties financing to 
						property taxes and allows inclusion of water conservation measures beyond those currently in the energy utility program. 
						This is really exciting, and I'm hoping we can expand these efforts statewide.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: Do you think different standards for water efficiency are being applied to renewable energy sources than to 
						traditional ones?
						<br><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" border="0"><br>
						DG:</strong>  Most of the new projects coming on  line are renewable projects, while a lot of the traditional power 
						plants were built 40 or 50 years ago when there was less concern for water efficiency. So it isn't that there is bias 
						against renewable projects, it's the reality that because of our state policies, we are paying more attention to water 
						usage and efficiency when we license power plants. We are going to have to have an appropriate balance between adding 
						significant renewable energy sources while ensuring that we protect water supplies. We will need to push the envelope 
						on the water efficiency of all new power plants, including renewables.

						<strong>Q: Do you think there is something the Carpe Diem Project could do to make conservation a bigger part of the 
						water-energy conversation?
						<br><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" border="0"><br>
						DG:</strong> Carpe Diem has a very important role to play. It brings together key stakeholders who are involved in both the 
						energy and water worlds, and it is helping us learn about the issues common to both of these areas. I think Carpe Diem 
						is an excellent forum for convening important discussions on those issues.
