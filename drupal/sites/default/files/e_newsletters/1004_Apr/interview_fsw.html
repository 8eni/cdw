						<strong>Q. You've noted the consensus that water conservation is one of our best and least-cost approaches to enhancing water supply and reducing energy costs but that we don't have the data to make the case in many western states. What would be your recommendation for developing the data?
 						<br><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" border="0"><br>
						FSW:</strong> The key is to have a campaign that will bring more parity between water and energy conservation. 
						Leadership at the federal level, particularly around the idea of parity between water and energy conservation, would 
						be very helpful. So would an energy policy that includes water and stimulates the collection of data on the energy 
						savings of water conservation. It will take incentives from the federal government to the states to make this happen. 
						At the moment, there is federal financing for renewables and energy agency charges for energy conservation, but there 
						is not much funding for water conservation. There should be incentives for both. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						The California Public Utility Commission studied embedded energy in water and identified groundwater pumping as a huge 
						source of energy consumption. More efficient pumps and pump software are being developed but on a relatively slow 
						track compared to other activities intended to reduce greenhouse gases and encourage renewable energy development. 
						Some groups in Texas are collecting data to support conservation, but the information sources are so decentralized 
						that getting adequate data is difficult.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: Do you agree with those who say that if California could establish programs that demonstrate the 
						effectiveness of integrated water and energy planning, they could go national? How would that work?
						<br><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" border="0"><br>
						FSW:</strong> California has two important assets. One is size, which translates into purchasing power and economic 
						leadership in the country. The second is that we have a reputation for being on the cutting edge of technologies and 
						approaches. In both of these areas California could be a leader for integrating water and energy, but so far it has 
						not been. This is largely because the agencies responsible for water and energy are only now starting to understand 
						each other's processes and to recognize the mutual benefits of working together. We will have to get out of our silos 
						if we are going to take this kind of leadership on the national stage. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						The Pacific Northwest has been the most explicit in showing leadership in these areas. In looking at the Northwest Power and 
						Conservation Council's <a href="http://www.nwcouncil.org/energy/powerplan/6/overview.htm" target="_blank" class="cd_link">energy management 
						report</a>,  I see elements in it that are not hydropower specific that could be applied elsewhere. They are 
						incentivizing energy and water conservation, and they are tracking the actual effect on demand of both types of 
						conservation. These approaches could apply across the country. Conservation is an asset.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: What do you think would be the best avenue for integrating water and energy efficiency planning?
						<br><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" border="0"><br>
						FSW:</strong> We've already talked about the importance of water and energy agencies working together. Again, this can 
						be encouraged by the federal government if they require coordination and collaboration when they make state grants. 
						I think California can continue to integrate planning and programs between its water and power agencies, but 
						incentives will speed the process.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						Additionally, at the direction of the governor, the State of California has formed climate action teams in various 
						subject areas &mdash; energy, water, health, biodiversity. What is interesting is that the one cost-cutting issue most of 
						these teams have identified is water. This underscores once again that integrating good water management and good 
						water-energy management into the state or federal approach to water and energy will have cascading effects into 
						protection of biodiversity, improved agricultural capability, and even improved public health.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: What could the Carpe Diem Project do to help make conservation a bigger part of the 
						water-energy conversation?
						<br><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" border="0"><br>
						FSW:</strong> Carpe Diem could hold a mini-convening of the federal and state government agencies and regional and 
						local agencies with on-the-ground experience in linking energy and water. The deliverable would be successful elements 
						or program criteria and processes that work to reduce energy use through water- and energy-efficiency projects.
