				  		A CONVERSATION WITH DR. HOLLY HARTMANN<br>

							<span class="quote_text_jul">&ldquo;It's like a Road Runner cartoon; the agencies have to turn around completely while their feet are still moving in a whirr in the other direction.&rdquo;</span>
						</td></tr></table>

						<strong>Q: At least 14 federal departments and agencies have climate change initiatives and many, many subsidiary 
						entities have their own climate change programs. Where does the western water community turn for needed 
						information?</strong>
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>HH:</strong> NOAA is where the climate work really starts, but other agencies are doing a lot. The field is 
						evolving quickly and constantly shifting. There are working groups, 
						pilot programs, informal collaborations. It's hard to get a handle on what's going on.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						What you hear a lot is: Wouldn't it be nice if one entity was keeping track of all this? There is an effort at the 
						federal level, but coordinating inside the Beltway is different from coordinating regionally on specific land and water 
						management issues. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						A big change has come with the Obama Administration. The shift is so strong that some agencies went from not being able 
						to use "climate" and "change" in the same sentence to a mandate to come up with response strategies and adaptation 
						plans by the end of this year. It's like a Road Runner cartoon; the agencies have to turn around completely while their 
						feet are still moving in a whirr in the other direction.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						The best place for federal level information that I'm aware of is the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force 
						being led by CEQ and OSTP and NOAA. They are tasked to come up with the interagency strategy at the federal level, 
						setting priorities and coordination and principles. October will be a milestone if you are thinking about when to check 
						in. That's when their report will come out.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						Another big piece is the change in the National Assessment mandated every four years from the USGCRP (formerly CCSP). 
						In the past years their products were reports which, as a series, have been very helpful. Now they are moving on to the 
						next step, saying we have to deal with climate science advances and adaptation as an ongoing process involving everyone. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: So, in this shifting landscape, the question still stands: where does the Western water community on the 
						ground go for information?</strong>
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>HH:</strong> It depends on where you are, and who you already know and work with. Every one of these federal 
						agencies is involved at some level with dealing with adaptation and climate change. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						If you are used to working with the Regional Integrated Science Assessment Projects, you can keep dealing with them, 
						though they are changing too. If you are working with USDA, the Forest Service will be able to tell you where to engage 
						on climate change issues. They now have clearance to address that openly. In every agency there will be someone you can 
						engage with. There are a lot more players, which is a good thing. It may take a few calls, but someone is coordinating. 
						You don't need to know to know all of these acronyms to connect with someone helpful.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						It's also location dependent. In the Northwest, the Forest Service is pushing the local, on-the-ground coordination. In 
						the Intermountain region, the National Park Service has a big push for coordination. For the Colorado Basin, the Bureau 
						of Reclamation now has clearance to coordinate with climate change issues. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						You have to remember that things are still so stovepiped that the Forest Service, for example, may not be aware of what 
						other parts of USDA are doing. If you are working with somebody in a federal agency, push them to figure out where the 
						coordination is happening.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						Finally, you don't need to just connect with the feds. There are a lot of informal, self-organizing groups among water 
						providers, for example. This reflects that people don't need to be convinced about the need for adaptation any more. 
						Now we're asking what do to, how to do it, and how to evaluate what's good to do. We've crossed that threshold, and 
						that's a positive message.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: How can the Carpe Diem Project help western water interests get the information they need?</strong>
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>HH:</strong> Because the Carpe Diem Project covers the whole West and has this strong network and connections 
						both with folks on the ground and in the Beltway, it's in a good position to facilitate communication. Things change 
						quickly, and Carpe Diem is really good at keeping tabs on issues as they emerge. Ideally, as the social media part of 
						the Project gets set up, it will help keep everyone informed about how things are developing. Nobody else is doing that 
						across the West.
