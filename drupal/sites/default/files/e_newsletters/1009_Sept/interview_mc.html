						<strong>Q:  Can you tell us a bit about your background and how you got involved in water issues?</strong>
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>MC:</strong> I grew up in Phoenix in a family where my father was a water rights attorney for the state of 
						Arizona. He represented the fun stuff &mdash; Game and Fish, the Parks Department. He would take me with him on these 
						field trips, usually to look at some dam in a remote corner of the state. We'd usually work in some fishing or hunting, 
						and he would talk about what was behind his work, things like how the Salt River used to have water in it. It made me 
						aware at an early age about how important water was. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						After college, I realized Arizona was never going to have enough trout for me, so I went to work up in Yellowstone, 
						which is the fishing capital of America, if not the planet. After a couple of years I had state residence in Montana, 
						so I went to law school in Missoula. I knew I wanted to work on water issues, and I had seen enough to know there were 
						different water interests &mdash; some doing good things, others not so much &mdash; and I wanted to work for the good guys.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						At that time, people who wanted to do environmental law could find a lot of work filing lawsuits to stop a development, 
						a mine, a dam. And there were tons of bright-eyed young law school grads wanting to do that. It was good work, 
						important work, but it left me feeling vaguely unsatisfied. It was not exactly focused on finding ways to make things 
						better or asking how we can move things forward. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>Q: How did you move from working to stop things to trying to move them forward?</strong>
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>MC:</strong> One of my clients was the Clark Fork Coalition. One day I walked into the director's office and 
						said, "Hire me as your staff attorney." And for some reason she did. The day I came on board we launched this 
						incredibly ambitious campaign to get a 100-year-old dam taken out. It wasn't doing anybody any good, but it had 6 
						million cubic yards of mining waste backed up behind it. Practically everyone thought it would be easiest to just shore 
						the thing up and leave it in place. We slowly pushed, asked agencies to take a harder look, and mounted a public 
						campaign to get people to think about the long-term legacy of leaving the dam there forever. We were eventually able to 
						move the needle of public opinion until it became obvious to everyone &mdash; right, left, and center &mdash; that the 
						best thing was to take out the dam and put that waste in a more stable place. The EPA received 10,000 comments saying, 
						"please take this dam out." And I thought, Wow! If people really come together, there tends to be a way. That really 
						happens.
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						A huge part of my work dealt with trying to get restoration on the upper 50 miles of the Clark Fork River, which is 
						the largest Superfund site in the country. The river's been polluted by a century of copper mining, but there's hope. 
						The state got over $200 million from the mining company that is specifically earmarked for restoration. It was really 
						gratifying to work with the community to get that money spent on projects to restore the river and turn it into an 
						asset, something that was not only beautiful but would help sustain the economy.

						<strong>Q: What was it about Carpe Diem that made you want to come on board?</strong>
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						<strong>MC:</strong> Carpe Diem attracted me because it offers a chance to do important work that moves the ball forward. 
						Western water issues are really complicated and divisive. What appeals to me is the chance to reach across divides and 
						bring people from the most diverse possible range of interests to work on the most divisive issues imaginable. 
						<table><tr><td><img src="images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="4" border="0"></td></tr></table>
						People complain that law school makes people narrow minded, but for me it was just the opposite. I learned to 
						see things from different perspectives. I could see that environmental damage doesn't always happen just because people 
						are evil or greedy, but because they have their own goals and perspectives. And when you realize that, you can start 
						to think about solutions.  I see this job as a perfect chance to put my skills to use.  It's daunting because the 
						problems are so huge &mdash; I mean, what's bigger than climate change?  But the flip side is that if you're successful, 
						you can make a real difference.
